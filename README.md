# TMOS_Romhack1
Makes modifications to a TMOS rom

To make a randomized rom:
1. Click Load ROM to select a specific ROM file, or click "Load Default ROM" to use one that is included in the project.

2. Click Randomize ROM. It will modify ROM contents, run some tests that will identify if the ROM is unbeatable. If not, it will pick another seed randomly and try again. It will repeat this process until it finds a seed that passes the tests.

3. Once the content has been modified, click "Patch ROM" and select a TMOS rom file to patch with the modified content.
